# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project description 

For this project I created possible cities for a customer to visit by generating random latitudes and longitudes. After that I asked what temperatures they would like during their vacation. Using that information along with gathering the weather data from the OpenWeather API I created a data frame of all the cities that were created previously with using random coordinates. after that I chose a feasable itinerary of four cities to visit. Using the gmaps API I created both trip directions and a name for a hotel closest to the cities they were visiting.
